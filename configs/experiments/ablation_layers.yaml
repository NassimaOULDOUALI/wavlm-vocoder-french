# Experiment: Layer Ablation Study
# Test different numbers of WavLM layers (N=1...12)

experiment:
  name: "layer_ablation"
  description: "Systematic ablation of WavLM layers"

# This will be overridden by run_ablation.py script
model:
  num_layers: ${num_layers}  # Will be set by script: 1, 2, ..., 12
  fusion_type: "average"  # Start with simple averaging

training:
  output_dir: "./outputs/experiments/ablation_layers_${num_layers}"
  num_epochs: 50  # Shorter training for ablation
